SoilPenRes provides tools for reading, cleaning, reshaping, and summarising
penetrologger (soil penetration resistance) data exported from ERP / Eijkelkamp systems.

The package supports reproducible workflows for:

Parsing raw .txt penetrologger files

Extracting metadata and coordinates

Converting wide depth profiles to tidy long format

Generating summary depth profiles (mean, SD, SEM)

Producing analysis-ready data for plotting and modelling

It is intended for researchers working with field-based soil compaction measurements.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SoilPenRes like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("joecollins/SoilPenRes")
```
